# 🏐 Volleyball Coach App - Development Documentation

## Project Overview

A professional volleyball coaching application that provides advanced rotation analysis and team management capabilities. The app replaces a complex Google Sheets + Apps Script system with a modern, responsive web application optimized for iPad use during volleyball matches and training sessions.

## Development History

### Initial Requirements Analysis
- **Original System**: Retool app (incomplete) + Google Sheets database + Google Apps Script
- **Primary Use Case**: In-game coaching assistance on iPad
- **Key Features Needed**: 
  1. RotationMap functionality
  2. In-game statistics tracking  
  3. Attack heatmap visualization
  4. Drill library management

### Technology Stack Selection

**Frontend Framework**: React with Vite
- Chosen for rapid development and modern tooling
- Excellent mobile/tablet optimization
- Component-based architecture ideal for complex UI

**Deployment Strategy**: Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Development Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation (Completed)
**Goal**: Establish basic volleyball app structure and deployment pipeline

**Deliverables**:
- React + Vite project setup
- PWA configuration with offline capability
- Simple 6-position volleyball court visualization
- Basic rotation mechanics (P1→P6 sequential)
- Netlify deployment pipeline
- Live URL: https://jazzy-alpaca-583263.netlify.app/

**Technical Decisions**:
- Vite for build tooling (faster than Create React App)
- CSS-in-JS avoided in favor of separate CSS files (better performance)
- Manual PWA configuration for precise offline behavior

### Phase 1: Professional Rotation System (Completed)
**Goal**: Implement complete volleyball rotation analysis system matching Google Apps Script functionality

**Key Components Built**:

#### 1. Volleyball Systems Engine (`volleyballSystems.js`)
```javascript
// Supported volleyball systems with exact position orders
VOLLEYBALL_SYSTEMS = {
  "5-1 (OH>S)": ["S", "OH (w.s)", "MB", "Oppo", "OH", "MB (w.s)"],
  "5-1 (MB>S)": ["S", "MB (w.s)", "OH", "Oppo", "MB", "OH (w.s)"],
  "4-2": ["S1", "OH1", "MB1", "S2", "OH2", "MB2"],
  "6-2": ["S1/OPP1", "MB1", "OH1", "S2/OPP2", "MB2", "OH2"]
}
```

**Core Functions**:
- `makeStartingOrder()`: Calculates rotation based on P1 starting position
- `getRotations()`: Generates all 6 serving rotations with libero substitution
- `getRallyLineup()`: Converts serving formation to rally formation

#### 2. Team Configuration Panel (`TeamConfigPanel.jsx`)
**Features**:
- Dual team input (Team A vs Team B)
- 7 position inputs per team: S, OH(w.s), MB, Oppo, OH, MB(w.s), L
- System selection dropdown (4 volleyball systems)
- P1 starting position selector
- Real-time validation and updates

**UI Design**:
- Spreadsheet-like interface matching original Google Sheets
- Color-coded sections (players, systems, starting positions)
- Responsive design for iPad and mobile

#### 3. Advanced Court Visualization (`AdvancedVolleyballCourt.jsx`)
**Features**:
- Proper volleyball court proportions and markings
- 6 positions with correct volleyball numbering (P1-P6)
- Formation type indicator (Serving vs Rally)
- Team color differentiation
- Server animation and indicators
- Player name, position, and role display

#### 4. Complete Rotation Display (`RotationDisplay.jsx`)
**Capabilities**:
- Displays all 6 rotations simultaneously
- Dual formation view (Serving + Rally) for each rotation
- Side-by-side team comparison
- Responsive grid layout
- Real-time updates when configuration changes

### Advanced Volleyball Logic Implementation

#### Libero Substitution Rules
```javascript
// Automatic substitution in back-row positions (P1, P5, P6)
[0, 4, 5].forEach(pos => {
  const role = occupantObjs[pos].role;
  if (role === 'MB' || role === 'MB (w.s)' || role === 'MB1' || role === 'MB2') {
    occupantObjs[pos] = { role: "L", name: teamObj["L"] };
  }
});
```

#### Rally Formation Logic
```javascript
// Front row specialization: MB→P3, OH→P4, S/Oppo→P2
// Back row specialization: L→P5, OH→P6, S/Oppo→P1
if (role.startsWith('MB')) rally.p3 = name;
else if (role.startsWith('OH')) rally.p4 = name;
else rally.p2 = name;
```

  registerType: 'autoUpdate',
  workbox: {
    globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg}']
  },
  manifest: {
    name: 'Volleyball Coach',
    display: 'standalone',
    orientation: 'any'
  }
})
```

### State Management Architecture
```javascript
// Centralized team configuration state
const [teamConfig, setTeamConfig] = useState({
  teamA: { players: {...}, system: "5-1 (OH>S)", startingP1: "OH" },
  teamB: { players: {...}, system: "5-1 (OH>S)", startingP1: "MB (w.s)" }
});

// Real-time propagation to all rotation displays
const handleConfigChange = (newConfig) => {
  setTeamConfig(newConfig); // Triggers recalculation of all rotations
};
```

### Responsive Design Strategy
