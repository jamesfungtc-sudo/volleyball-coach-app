## How to Use These Agents

### In Claude Code CLI
```bash
# General syntax
@agent-name your request here

# Examples:
@frontend-developer Build a statistics tracking component for volleyball matches
@ui-ux-designer Design the in-game stats page layout for iPad
@test-automator Write tests for the volleyball rotation calculations
@performance-engineer Optimize the court rendering for 24 simultaneous courts
@data-scientist Create a heatmap visualization for attack positions
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use agents proactively** - They are designed to be called when working on related tasks
2. **Combine agents** - Use multiple agents for complex features (e.g., ui-ux-designer + frontend-developer)
3. **Specify context** - Provide details about your volleyball app when asking
4. **Reference existing code** - Point agents to current implementation patterns

### Project-Specific Context

When using these agents, provide this context:
- **Tech Stack:** React 19, Vite, React Router, PWA
- **Current Features:** Rotation visualization, 4 volleyball systems support
- **Roadmap:** Statistics tracking, heatmaps, team management
- **Target Device:** Primarily iPad for in-game coaching
- **Design:** Responsive, mobile-first, offline-capable

## Agent Source

These agents are sourced from [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) - a production-ready collection of Claude Code subagents.

## Customization

You can customize these agents by:
1. Editing the `.md` files directly
2. Adding project-specific knowledge
3. Adjusting the behavioral traits for your needs
4. Creating new agents based on these templates
