## How to Use These Agents

### In Claude Code CLI
```bash
# General syntax
@agent-name your request here

# Examples:
@frontend-developer Build a statistics tracking component for volleyball matches
@ui-ux-designer Design the in-game stats page layout for iPad
@test-automator Write tests for the volleyball rotation calculations
@performance-engineer Optimize the court rendering for 24 simultaneous courts
@data-scientist Create a heatmap visualization for attack positions

# NEW: Analysis agents for understanding OldTool
@architect-review Analyze the OldTool system design and explain the logical reasoning behind its architecture
@business-analyst Review OldTool and explain what user value it provides for volleyball coaches
@code-reviewer Review the OldTool code for quality, security, and migration considerations
```

### Recommended Workflow for Analyzing OldTool

For comprehensive understanding of your OldTool system, use this sequence:

1. **Start with business-analyst** - Understand WHAT user value it provides and WHY it exists
2. **Then use architect-review** - Understand HOW the system is designed and the logical reasoning
3. **Finally use code-reviewer** - Understand technical quality and migration considerations

Example:
```bash
# Step 1: Understand user value and purpose
@business-analyst Review the files in OldTool/ directory and explain:
- What problems does this app solve for volleyball coaches?
- What is the core user value and workflow?
- What features are most critical for users?

# Step 2: Understand architectural design and logic
@architect-review Analyze the OldTool/ files and explain:
- What is the system architecture and design rationale?
- How do the components work together?
- What are the key design decisions and why were they made?

# Step 3: Understand technical implementation
@code-reviewer Review the OldTool/ code files and assess:
- Code quality and technical patterns used
- Security considerations and potential vulnerabilities
- What needs attention when migrating to the new React app?
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use agents proactively** - They are designed to be called when working on related tasks
2. **Combine agents** - Use multiple agents for complex features (e.g., ui-ux-designer + frontend-developer)
3. **Specify context** - Provide details about your volleyball app when asking
4. **Reference existing code** - Point agents to current implementation patterns

### Project-Specific Context

When using these agents, provide this context:
- **Tech Stack:** React 19, Vite, React Router, PWA
- **Current Features:** Rotation visualization, 4 volleyball systems support
- **Roadmap:** Statistics tracking, heatmaps, team management
- **Target Device:** Primarily iPad for in-game coaching
- **Design:** Responsive, mobile-first, offline-capable

## Agent Source

These agents are sourced from [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) - a production-ready collection of Claude Code subagents.

## Customization

You can customize these agents by:
1. Editing the `.md` files directly
2. Adding project-specific knowledge
3. Adjusting the behavioral traits for your needs
4. Creating new agents based on these templates
