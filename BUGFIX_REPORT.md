## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: Duplicate StatsPage Files

The application had BOTH old and new versions of the StatsPage component:
- **Old**: `src/pages/StatsPage.jsx` (mockup from before TypeScript implementation)
- **New**: `src/pages/StatsPage.tsx` (TypeScript implementation with full InGame Stats)

**Module Resolution**: Vite was importing the `.jsx` file instead of the new `.tsx` file, causing the app to display the old mockup UI which:
- Had hardcoded "Eagles" team name
- Used placeholder empty buttons
- Did not have the new PointEntryForm component
- Did not have proper ActionTypes integration

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### Solution: Remove Duplicate File

**Action Taken**:
```bash
rm src/pages/StatsPage.jsx
```

**Result**: Vite now correctly imports `StatsPage.tsx` with full InGame Stats implementation

---

## üß™ Verification

### Files Verified Correct:

1. **ActionTypes Data** (`src/constants/actionTypes.ts`) ‚úÖ
   - Matches OldTool structure 100%
   - Win categories: Att., Ser., Blo., Op. E., Other
   - Loss categories: Op. Att., Op. Ace, Sp. E., Ser. E., Other
   - All subcategories and location/tempo options present

2. **Mock Data** (`src/pages/StatsPage.tsx`) ‚úÖ
   - Home team: "Eagles" with 6 players
   - Opponent team: "Hawks" with 6 players
   - Proper team structure with names and jersey numbers

3. **Component Implementation** (`src/features/inGameStats/components/`) ‚úÖ
   - WinLossToggle - Renders "Point WIN" / "Point LOSS" buttons
   - SegmentedControl - Renders action type buttons
   - ConditionalDropdown - Shows subcategory and location/tempo dropdowns
   - PlayerSelector - Filters players by team
   - PointByPointList - 3-column color-coded display

   - Click "Point WIN"
   - Click "Att."
   - Select "Hard Spike" from dropdown
   - Select "OH (Line)" from location dropdown
   - Select "#1 Amei - OH" from player dropdown

## üîß Technical Notes

### Why This Happened

During the TypeScript migration, the old `StatsPage.jsx` mockup was not deleted when `StatsPage.tsx` was created. JavaScript module resolution prioritized `.jsx` over `.tsx` in some scenarios.

### Prevention

**Best Practice**: When migrating from `.jsx` to `.tsx`:
1. Rename the old file to `.backup.jsx` first
2. Create and test the new `.tsx` file
3. Only delete the backup once confirmed working
4. Use `git status` to check for duplicate files

### Files Modified
- ‚úÖ Deleted: `src/pages/StatsPage.jsx`
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Preserved: `src/pages/StatsPage.tsx` (active)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Preserved: `src/pages/StatsPage.css` (styles)

## ‚úÖ Status: RESOLVED

All reported UI issues were caused by the duplicate file problem and should be fixed now. Please test at the new URL and report any remaining issues.
